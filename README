This is an implementation of the algorithm computing the Mondshein sequence for a given 3-connected graph introduced in:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0750.pdf

The algorithm itself works in the complexity of O(m), but one of the helper-structures (the one in 'paths') works in O(mlog(m)).

The 'main' program takes the input graph from the standard input and computes its Mondshein sequence.
The 'test n' script runs main on many random graphs created with n bg-operations.

The 'bgseq' module contains the implementation of bg-sequence computation.
The 'order' module contains the implementation of the total order maintenance algorithm.
The 'paths' module contains the implementation of the data structure maintaining edge-disjoint paths.
